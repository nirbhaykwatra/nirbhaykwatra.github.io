 ## Design Ideas
 - Make 2 versions of the website
    - V1 is a basic, good looking static website (vanilla HTML/CSS/TS) with concise text boxes up front and a lengthier article hidden behind a button.
    - V2 is the fun website. three.js background, amazing UX, smooth animations, the whole deal. This is where you get to be you.
    - Each website immediately has a button to go to the other website.
 - Create a "Project Graveyard" section with all the abandoned/cryo-statis side projects
    - Talk about why you started the project, why you abandoned it and if it's something you would be interested in going back to.
 - For game jam projects, show the code as it was during the jam and then show it after it was refactored. This will provide a lot of insight into your prototyping process and how you approach refinement afterwards.
